Write a program using function to calculate the simple interest. Suppose the 
customer is a senior citizen. He is being offered 12 percent rate of interest; 
for all other customers, the ROI is 10 percent.

Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
int pri=input.nextInt();
int year=input.nextInt();
char age=input.next().charAt(0);
double interest=0.0;
if(age=='y')
{
 interest=(pri*year*0.12)/100;
 System.out.print(interest);
}
else
{
 interest=(pri*year*0.1)/100;
 System.out.print(interest);
}
Input:
Enter the principal amount: 200000
Enter the no of years: 3
Is customer senior citizen (y/n): n
 Output:
Interest: 60000
