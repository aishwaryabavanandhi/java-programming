Write a program to find whether the person is eligible for vote or not. And if that 
particular person is not eligible, then print how many years are left to be eligible.

Scanner input=new Scanner(System.in);
int age=input.nextInt();
if(age>18)
 System.out.print("you are eligible for vote");
else if(age<=0)
 System.out.print("Enter the age correctly");
else
 System.out.print("you are allowed to vote after"+(18-age));
Input:
Enter your age:
7
output:
You are allowed to vote after 11 years
